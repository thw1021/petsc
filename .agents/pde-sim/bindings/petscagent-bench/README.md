# pde-sim binding for petscagent-bench

Exposes the pde-sim pipeline as the **Purple agent** (agent-under-test) in
[petscagent-bench](https://github.com/petsc/petscagent-bench), so pde-sim can be
scored by the same gates/metrics/quality evaluators as any other code-generation
agent — **without modifying any bench source**.

## How it works

The bench Green agent is decoupled from the Purple *implementation*: it reads the
purple **URL** from its task message and talks A2A/HTTP only. This binding is a
standalone A2A server implementing the Purple contract:

1. Green sends a plain-text `problem_description`.
2. `pdesim_purple.py` drives pde-sim non-interactively via `claude -p` in
   **autonomous** mode, writing artifacts under a per-request study dir.
3. It reads the pipeline's `results-manifest.json`, then returns:
   - a `TextPart`: `Code generation successful` / `nsize:` / `cli_args:`
     (`nsize` = the chosen run's `mpi_ranks`; `cli_args` = its `command` with the
     `mpiexec -n N ./exe` prefix stripped),
   - a `FilePart` per generated source (main `.c` first, plus `.cu` /
     `*.kokkos.cxx` dependencies). The makefile is intentionally **not** sent —
     the bench's MCP server builds its own.
4. Green uploads the source via MCP, compiles, runs with `nsize`/`cli_args`, and
   scores it.

## Prerequisites

- The `claude` CLI on `PATH` (or set `PDESIM_CLAUDE_BIN`), logged in, able to run
  the `/pde-sim` pipeline in this repo.
- A working PETSc build reachable via `PETSC_DIR` / `PETSC_ARCH` in the
  environment (pde-sim compiles/verifies; the bench independently recompiles).
- A prepared petscagent-bench checkout. It needs Python 3.12+ and
  [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv); `uv sync` installs the pinned
  dependencies from its `uv.lock`:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/petsc/petscagent-bench && cd petscagent-bench
  uv sync
  ```

  The bench reads its own `.env` from that directory (the Green judge's LLM key
  — `ARGO_API_KEY` for Argo — and the `PETSC_DIR`/`PETSC_ARCH` it compiles
  against); see its README for the full list. This binding does not read `.env`,
  so it takes `PETSC_DIR`/`PETSC_ARCH` from the environment it is started in.
- The A2A server deps (`a2a-sdk[http-server]`, `uvicorn`), which `uv sync` above
  already provides. Simplest is to run this file from that same `uv` env.

## Run it (no bench code changes)

`run_pdesim.sh` is the usual way in. Driving the components by hand is the
fallback, for when you want one problem against a Purple you start and keep
under your own control.

### Driver: `run_pdesim.sh`

Runs a set of configs over a set of problems, one repeat each. Nothing needs to
be up first: `main.py launch` starts the Green agent and the MCP server itself,
so the script refuses to begin if port 8080, 9001, or 9002 is already bound.

```bash
cd $PETSC_DIR
RUN=.agents/pde-sim/bindings/petscagent-bench/run_pdesim.sh

$RUN -p '*' -c 1,2,3          # the full matrix: every problem on every rung
$RUN -p darcy -c 3            # one problem, one config
$RUN -p darcy,robertson -c 1  # two problems on config 1
$RUN                          # the defaults: advection on config 1, the cheapest
```

A `-p` term matches part of a problem name, ignoring case, and may be a glob, so
`-p darcy` selects `DarcyFlow2D_Steady` and `-p '*'` selects all seven. Preview a
selection without running anything with `uv run main.py problems darcy` from the
bench checkout. Configs run one after another, each with a fresh Purple.

Less common, but useful when comparing models or running unattended:

```bash
$RUN -p darcy -c 3 -m 'claudeopus48[1m]'   # quote: the brackets are shell globs
$RUN -p '*' -c 1,2,3 -i 300                # a progress line every 5 min
$RUN -p darcy -c 3 -i 0                    # no progress lines at all
$RUN -p darcy -c 3 -b ~/some/other/bench   # a different bench checkout
```

`RUN` above is a relative path, which is what needs the `cd`; the script itself
works from any directory, since it changes to the bench checkout on its own.

Without `-b`, the bench checkout comes from `$PETSCAGENT_BENCH`, else
`~/petscagent-bench`. `PETSC_DIR` and `PETSC_ARCH` select the PETSc build and
must both be set; the script picks neither for you. `--help` lists the defaults.

For each config it launches the Purple with `PDESIM_CONFIG` set, waits for it to
serve, sends the selected problems, and tears it down. The Purple self-reports its
model (`pdesim-<model>-cN`) in its telemetry, so Green names the output file from
it and the configs self-sort. Between configs it clears the three things that
would otherwise leak a prior run into this one — `artifacts/`, the pde-sim case
index, and Green's response cache — moving prior results and study dirs into
`artifacts_runs/run_<timestamp>/` rather than deleting them.

While a config runs, the script prints a progress line every `-i` seconds
summarizing the newest study dir's `transcript.stream.jsonl`: elapsed time, event
count, and the most recent tool call or message. The bench's own launch log is
silent for the length of the run, so this is the only live signal. As each
problem finishes it also reports that problem's wall time, `total_cost_usd`, and
status, read from the `result` event the CLI writes at the end of the study. A
problem killed at `PDESIM_TIMEOUT` emits no such event and so is not reported.

The result is Green's per-problem JSONs under `output/`. Comparing configs is a
separate step; this binding ships no aggregator.

### Redoing one problem, and re-grading without regenerating

Both use the bench's problem selection, so neither needs a fresh full matrix:

- **Redo a problem** that failed for a reason unrelated to the agent wiring:
  `run_pdesim.sh -p darcy -c 3`. `uv run main.py problems darcy` previews the
  selection, and Green records it as `problem_filter`, so a redo stays
  distinguishable from a full sample when the run files are compared.
- **Re-grade recorded submissions** under a changed grader or judge, without
  calling the Purple at all:
  `uv run main.py launch --replay output/<prefix>-run1.json`. The run file carries
  each submission's sources, `requested_nsize`, and `cli_args`, so the rescore
  goes through the same compile/run path. Those records are flagged
  `purple_response_replayed`: they re-judge a submission from the run that
  generated it, so compare the two run files directly.

### Running the components by hand

This path drives the bench's separate components through `client_cli.py`, so the
Purple is a server you start yourself and can restart, attach to, or point
elsewhere between runs.

Export the needed environment first (the MCP server and the pde-sim pipeline need
`PETSC_DIR`/`PETSC_ARCH`; the Green judge needs its LLM key — `ARGO_API_KEY` for
Argo). `uv run` does not read the bench's `.env`, so export them in the shells:

```bash
export PETSC_DIR=/path/to/petsc PETSC_ARCH=your-arch ARGO_API_KEY=your_anl_username

# 1) Green agent (from the bench repo/venv) — :9001
cd ~/petscagent-bench && uv run src/green_agent/server.py &

# 2) PETSc compile/run MCP server — :8080
#    petsc_mcp_servers ships as a bench dependency (petsc-ai-servers-clients),
#    so its module is importable from the bench env. main() defaults to
#    streamable-http on :8080 with the /mcp endpoint:
cd ~/petscagent-bench && \
  uv run python -c "from petsc_compile_run_mcp_server import main; main()" &

# 3) This binding as the Purple agent — :9002
#    Run from the bench env so a2a-sdk/uvicorn are available:
cd ~/petscagent-bench && \
  uv run python ~/petsc/.agents/pde-sim/bindings/petscagent-bench/pdesim_purple.py &

# 4) Trigger the run, pointing Green at this binding's URL
cd ~/petscagent-bench && uv run src/client_cli.py \
  --green-url http://localhost:9001 \
  --purple-url http://localhost:9002 \
  --mcp-server-url http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

Results land in the bench's `output/` as usual. The bench's
`config/purple_agent_config.yaml` is **unused** here (it configures the built-in
purple's LLM); the Green config still applies.

| `PDESIM_TIMEOUT`                      | `2900`                                              | per-problem seconds. Hard ceiling is the bench's Green→Purple HTTP read timeout, hardcoded`read=3000.0` in `src/util/a2a_comm.py` (no env override), so the default leaves ~100s to kill the CLI, save the transcript and answer. The full config-3 pipeline can still exceed this on the heavier problems; going higher needs that bench-side read timeout raised too. A run killed at this limit is still recorded in the usage sidecar (see below)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `CLAUDE_ASYNC_AGENT_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS` | `1200000` (this binding; CLI default is `600000`) | Claude CLI knob (milliseconds): a Task subagent with no streamed progress for this long is aborted and reported to the orchestrator as a stall. The binding raises the default to 20 min via`setdefault` so a long code-generation step is not reaped mid-run; export your own value to override (e.g. `3600000` for 1 h). There is no documented value that fully disables it — set it large.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Model I/O: The CLI runs with `--output-format stream-json`, so `transcript.stream.jsonl` is appended one event per line as the run happens (`tail -f` it to watch it grow). Readable `.md` files are re-rendered every ~3s and once at the end: each turn timestamped `[HH:MM:SS]` local, each tool result showing the tool and its duration (e.g. `(Bash, 5.4s)`), plus a same-named `.json` sibling with the full, UNtruncated events (look up any `…[truncated]` there), plus `transcript-stderr.log`. Single-agent runs get `transcript.{md,json}`; config 3 splits by role into `transcript-{orchestrator,pde-modeling,numerical-analysis,code-generation,visualization}.{md,json}` (split by `parent_tool_use_id`, roles from the dispatch prompt). Each per-role file grows **live**: it appears the moment its subagent is dispatched and gains one timestamped progress line per tool the subagent runs (from the CLI's `task_*` events, which are the only material available before the subagent's full turns arrive), so a long code-generation step is visible step-by-step and a stall shows as a growing time gap; the coarse progress lines are superseded by the full detailed turns once the subagent completes. Set `0` to disable |

### Per-stage attempts in the usage sidecar

Each `PDESIM_USAGE_DIR` record carries two attempt counts, recorded **binding-side
only** (they are deliberately *not* part of the bench `petscagent.telemetry.v1`
contract, so `_build_telemetry` does not forward them to the Green agent — how the
bench should aggregate attempts is left to the bench maintainers):

- `stage_attempts` — a map of how many times the orchestrator dispatched each
  specialist, keyed by the same `role[-stage]` label as the split transcripts
  (e.g. `{"pde-modeling": 1, "numerical-analysis-plan": 1, "numerical-analysis-assess": 1, "code-generation": 1}`). Normally 1 per stage (2
  for numerical-analysis: plan and assess); a value `>1` means the orchestrator
  re-dispatched that stage, e.g. a revise-plan feedback loop. Empty for configs 1–2
  (no subagents).
- `code_generation_iterations` — the length of the code-generation stage's own
  build/run/format fix loop, taken from the manifest's `attempts[]` journal (the
  number of tries that stage needed, distinct from how many times it was
  *dispatched*).

A usage record is written on **every** path — success, timeout, or failure — so a
run's consumption is never silently lost. A run killed at `PDESIM_TIMEOUT` emits
no final `result` event and therefore reports no cost, so its record carries
`"partial": true` and `"total_cost_usd": null`; its token counts are summed from
the individual turns, which is how billing actually accrues, so the run can still
be priced after the fact.

## Ablation configurations (`PDESIM_CONFIG`)

The binding doubles as the agent-under-test for the three-rung ablation in
`EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md` (repo root). One code path, selected by `PDESIM_CONFIG`:

| # | Config                      | Gating (`--disallowed-tools`)         | Prompt                                                                                                    |
| - | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | General coding agent        | `Task` (subagent) + `Skill` blocked | plain "write PETSc code"                                                                                  |
| 2 | Single-context pipeline     | `Task` blocked                        | run the pde-sim workflow itself: read the orchestration`SKILL.md` (steps) + domain skills; no subagents |
| 3 | Specialized + scoped skills | none                                    | full pde-sim pipeline, orchestrator dispatches role agents (default)                                      |

Config 2 reads the **same** pde-sim knowledge as config 3 — the orchestration
`SKILL.md` for the end-to-end workflow plus the domain skills — but performs every
step itself in one context (the dispatch parts of the orchestration skill are inert
without the Agent tool). So **2→3 isolates agent specialization alone**, not the
knowledge available; **1→2 isolates the pde-sim knowledge** (workflow + skills).

All three run at the **repo root**, so they share identical project context
(`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`); the only thing that changes across the ladder is the
tool gating. The output/deliverable contract (output discipline, direct run
command, manifest, `PDESIM_DONE` marker) is shared verbatim across all three so
scoring differences reflect the wiring, not prompt wording.

Gating **verified** against Claude CLI 2.1.281: `--disallowed-tools "Task Skill"`
removes both the subagent tool (displayed as `Agent`; `Task` is its disallow alias)
and `Skill`; `--disallowed-tools Task` removes the subagent tool while keeping
`Skill`. Names stay overridable via `PDESIM_DISALLOWED_TOOLS` should a future CLI
rename them.

## Known limitations / things to watch

- **Grader mismatch is the main risk.** The bench's `numerical_accuracy` metric
  reads the *trailing N numeric lines* of stdout (N = length of the problem's
  hidden `expected_output`) and compares them to that reference; only
  `problem_description` is given to the agent — `test_cases` (`args` /
  `expected_output`) are not. The binding's prompt therefore tells pde-sim to
  emit **only** the output the description asks for (e.g. the final solution via
  `VecView()`) and to keep extra numeric diagnostics off stdout. A correct
  solution can still miss the metric if the description's output format is
  ambiguous; remaining cases need per-problem handling in the bench evaluators.
- **Run selection is a heuristic.** The binding sends the first successful run's
  `command`/`mpi_ranks`. If a problem needs a different run, adjust `_pick_run`.
- **cli_args are passed verbatim** after stripping the launcher/exe prefix,
  including MMS-specific flags (e.g. `-mms_levels 4`, `-mms_csv convergence.csv`);
  the latter just writes a file in the bench work dir.
- **A2A SDK / telemetry.** The bench uses the protobuf-based **a2a-sdk 1.x**; this
  binding imports its A2A types and helpers from the bench's own shims
  (`src.util.a2a_v1`, `src.util.telemetry`), so it must be launched from the bench
  repo root (it adds the cwd to `sys.path`). It reports token/cost/effort to the
  bench in a versioned data Part (`petscagent.telemetry.v1`) via `_build_telemetry()`.
- **Cost/time.** A full pde-sim pipeline (multi-agent, MMS studies, retries) uses
  far more tokens/time per problem than a single-shot purple agent. The binding runs
  the CLI with `--output-format json`; the reported token counts are the **top-level
  agent's** (subagent tokens excluded), so the whole-run `cost_usd` /
  `total_cost_usd` is the trustworthy total-cost figure. It is also written to the
  `PDESIM_USAGE_DIR` sidecar and aggregated into the report's `Gen $` column.
- **`bypassPermissions` runs arbitrary Bash** — only run against a sandboxed
  PETSc build.
